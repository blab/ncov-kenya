This phylogenetic analysis was designed to analyze samples collected by the Kenya Research Group in the context of other SARS-CoV-2 samples in Kenya.
Background SARS-CoV-2 samples are pulled from Nextstrain's [preprocessed files](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/ncov/en/latest/reference/remote_inputs.html) which are created from sequences in [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
